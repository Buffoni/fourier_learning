# Spectral Learning
This repository contains the code to reproduce some of the results in: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21481-0

The module ```SpectralLayer.py``` contains an implementation of the spectral layer class that can be easily embedded in every Tensorflow model.

The notebook ```Spactral_Layer_example.ipynb``` contains a usage example.

Dependecies:
```
tensorflow > 2.0
numpy
